OPA tools and Fast Fabric
-------------------------

* To build the RPM and SRPM:

  1. mkdir -p $HOME/rpmbuild/{SOURCES,RPMS,SRPMS}
  2. tar czf $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES/opa.tgz --exclude-vcs .
  3. rpmbuild -ba ./opa-ff.spec

  This will build the opa-basic-tools, opa-fastfabric, and opa-address-resolution
  RPMs in $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/(architecture)/

  This will also create a opa-debuginfo RPM, which by default contains basic symbol
  information - see below on how to build with full debugging information.

* To build in this directory:

 1. ./ff_build.sh .



* How to include debugging symbols:

  export BUILD_CONFIG=debug

  prior to either of the aforementioned build procedures.
