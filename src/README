OPA tools and Fast Fabric
-------------------------

* To build the RPM and SRPM:

  1. mkdir -p $HOME/rpmbuild/{SOURCES,RPMS,SRPMS}
  2. ./update_opa-ff.spec.sh opa-ff.spec.in opa-ff.spec
  3. tar czf $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES/opa.tgz --exclude-vcs .
  4. rpmbuild -ba ./opa-ff.spec

  This will build the opa-basic-tools, opa-fastfabric, and opa-address-resolution
  RPMs in $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/(architecture)/

  This will also create a opa-debuginfo RPM, which by default contains basic symbol
  information - see below on how to build with full debugging information.

* How to include debugging symbols:

  export BUILD_CONFIG=debug

  prior to the aforementioned build procedure.
